# Production-Scheduling
A production process with unrelated parallel machines and Sequence-dependent setting times.

1. Each work order has to be processed strictly in a certain order.
2. Each work order is assigned to exactly one machine for completion
process.
3. Each work order change involves setup or adjustment time, and these are
they know
4. Processing times for each work order are machine dependent
and they know each other.
5. There are unrelated (non-identical) parallel machines, so the commands
Work cannot be processed on any machine.
6. If you want to generate a compact production schedule, that is, minimize the makepan
o maximum completion time
